Our logistics department handles various tax and customs services such as: transits, customs clearance, 
export of goods and excise processing.

When a delivery from our suppliers arrives at our warehouse, it is processed by this department,
who handles yearly volumes of over 84.000 pallets. When an order comes through to our logistic centre, 
from our clients or PSRs, the team enables its fulfilment promptly and always within 24 hours. 

The Supply Chain Management team is in place to also better manage stock by:

* Reducing stock levels to an optimum, calculated based on the sales volume in the lead time
* Avoiding out-of-stock situations despite a large number of SKUs and suppliers
* First In First Out (FIFO) and First Expiry First Out (FEFO) handling of products
* Using motorised vehicles (such as forklifts and electric transpallets) for transporting all goods within the warehouse
* Using a coordinate system for organising the warehouse, which also facilitates the job of the warehouse employees
