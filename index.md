Established in 1991, Marketing & Distribution (M&D) is a customer oriented organisation involved in the import, distribution &amp; marketing of a wide variety of products including:
<ul>
<li>Health, Home &amp; Beauty</li>
<li>Food &amp; Drinks</li>
<li>Alcohol &amp; Cigarettes</li>
<li>Office &amp; Stationary</li>
<li>Mobile Communications</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: larger;"><b>Why M&amp;D</b></p>
Our company, has for several years been among the top 10 companies in Albania as measured by turnover, importing and distributing market leading brands to over 4200 varied customers from supermarkets, groceries, variety stores and wholesalers, to pharmacies, offices, hotels, cafes and restaurants. 

Our customer base exceeds 4200 customers and we deal with more than 450 invoices every day, covering 100% of the Albanian territory and population as well as Kosovo. The customer base is divided into segments, based on both customer and commercial criteria, to allow us to put the consumer at the heart of what we do and at the same time maximise the rate of return on the investments made into outlets.

We invest 60% of our yearly profit back into our business, to enable us to continuously expand by building new distribution centres, increasing the capacity of the existing warehouses, as well as refreshing &amp; expanding our vehicle fleet. 

M&D overheads account for only 1.6% of our turnover, as a result of careful and well planned sharing of the supporting structures and people throughout our principals.	Through increased product rotation, reduced overheads and better stock management we have been able to continuously improve our net profits.
